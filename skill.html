            <p>One of my skills is working with HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which is used to create and structure web pages. I enjoy using HTML because it is simple and allows me to design the layout of websites by adding headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Learning HTML has taught me attention to detail, as even small mistakes can affect a webpage. I’ve created projects like personal portfolios and basic websites, which have helped me understand the basics of web development. This skill is something I’m proud of and excited to improve in the future.</p>

            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is where my creativity comes to life. I excel at transforming static HTML into visually engaging and interactive web experiences. With a strong understanding of layout principles, I use flexbox and grid systems to create responsive designs that look flawless on any device. My attention to detail ensures that every pixel is perfectly placed, while my knowledge of animations and transitions adds a touch of elegance and dynamism to every project. From typography and color theory to accessibility best practices, I leverage the full power of CSS to build user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing websites.</p>

            <p>Photos are only proof of our memories, and those memories are what we live for in life. That's why I took it to the next level and studied photography. A photo is not just a photo. It includes moments, memories, people, and the most important thing, emotions. This is a photo I took back in my country of a bridge connecting a stream in the forest. It shows the feeling of an ethernal darkness. Like the bridge is taking us into the darkness and we are follwing that path wondering what miight be inside of that darkness. <br> Location: December Park, Pyin Oo Lwin, Myanmar <br> Shot on: Sony A6400, 16-50mm F2.6-5.4 ISO:400</p>
